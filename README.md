# Snippets
A Developer Recipe Book

Learning to code is not the easiest journey to take.  The good news is that as I progressed in said journey, I picked up a lot of different tricks and shortcuts that have won me beautiful sites that I am very proud of.  

One big lesson, I learned is that with every project I've built, there was always some piece of code I was able to reuse from an old project.  The problem was that after nearly 50 repos (so far), it's hard to remember which one had the snippet I needed for my current project and for that matter, where to look.  So I decided to start consolidating my code in one repo, especially those from React.js.  

React.js is such a complex yet fun framework to learn.  When I succeed in getting an app to work, for the first time, it's a huge victory.  The problem is, if I were to create another project similar to that one, a month or two down the road, I'm not quite sure if I'll recall how to do it again.  Time is not a luxury, we Developers have.  So I hope this recipe book helps you as much as much as it helps me.
